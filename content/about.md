My name is Danny van der Biezen. I'm a 25 year old guy from The Netherlands; currently based in Auckland, New Zealand with plans to move to the United Kingdom in the near future!

I'm a software engineer working mostly with .NET and JavaScript/TypeScript these days. I use my extensive knowledge about DevOps practices to get my team as productive as possible.

I love following and contributing to open-source projects, with my main focus being on .NET Core, Aurelia and React. In the future I might start streaming while working on open-source projects

Besides programming, I love watching Netflix, travelling and wasting time playing video games I will never be good at :(.

You can [email](mailto:danny_bies@live.nl) me if you want to discuss anything related to programming, or anything else really :)
